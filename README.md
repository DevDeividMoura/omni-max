## ‚ù§Ô∏è About the Project

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Omni Max was born from a real need: **customer service work doesn't have to be so exhausting.** If you agree, star this repository to give us a boost! ‚≠êÔ∏è

Omni Max is your new secret weapon for the ASC SAC platform (and its white-label variations). A supercharged friend with Artificial Intelligence, designed to automate the boring and repetitive tasks.

Our goal is simple: reduce stress, optimize your time, and allow you to focus on what really matters: delivering exceptional, human-centered service.

## ‚ú® What Does Omni Max Actually Do?

Omni Max has evolved! In addition to the classic features, you now have a true AI ecosystem at your disposal:

* ü§ñ **AI with Full Context for Real Help:** The assistant arrives knowing everything! It reads the entire conversation with the customer and uses LangChain and LangGraph to give you relevant help, without you wasting time explaining the obvious.

* üß† **Your Private Response Library:** Upload manuals, procedures, or any document (.md, .txt). The AI consults this base to provide accurate answers based on *your* data. It's like having your company's expert available 24/7.

* üé≠ **The AI Actor:** Want the AI to sound like a "Billing Expert" or a "Friendly Tier 1 Support"? You create the "Personas," define the tone of voice, the rules, and even which tools it can use. You're the director!

* üõ†Ô∏è **Tools Up Its Sleeve:** The AI doesn't pull answers out of thin air, it searches for them! With access to tools like your knowledge base, the information is always fact-based.

* üîó **You Choose the Magic:** Prefer **OpenAI**? A fan of **Google Gemini**? Or want to use a model running on your own PC with **Ollama**? You're in charge here. Connect your favorite AI provider.

**And for the day-to-day?**

* üìù **Magic Templates:** Answer frequent questions with a click. Insert names and variables automatically, quickly, and without errors.

* üñ±Ô∏è **Life-Saving Shortcuts:** Copy name, ID, and other information with a simple keyboard shortcut. It's almost... magic.

* üé® **The Layout is Yours:** Does the conversation list on the right bother you? Move it to the left! Adjust the small details of the interface so everything is exactly where you like it.

* ‚öôÔ∏è **You're in Command (Modular Design):** Omni Max adapts to you. Enable or disable each feature to create your perfect work experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Under the Hood? (Main Technologies)

* **[LangChain](https://js.langchain.com/)** ‚Äì A library to orchestrate calls to AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google GenAI, etc.), used in the Agent.

* **[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/)** ‚Äì An extension of the LangChain library for building stateful agents, used to give the assistant the ability to remember context, use tools to fetch context, query the knowledge base, and more.

* **[IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)**: Used for the knowledge base `VectorStore` and for saving the agent's conversation state (`Checkpointer`).

* **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)** (v5) ‚Äì A lightweight reactive framework for building the UI.

* **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** ‚Äì Static typing and autocompletion, ensuring more robust code.

* **[CRXJS Vite Plugin](https://github.com/crxjs/chrome-extension-tools/blob/main/packages/vite-plugin/README.md)** ‚Äì A plugin that integrates Manifest V3 into the Vite workflow, necessary for modern Chrome extensions.

* **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + [Vitest-Chrome](https://github.com/antonyg/sample-vitest-chrome)** ‚Äì Unit and integration testing suite specific to extension environments.

* **[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** ‚Äì CI/CD for checking (svelte-check), testing, building, and automatically deploying to the Chrome Web Store.
